/**
 * Encapsulation of the constructor arguments of <tt>MFCSignatureService</tt>.
 * The number of arguments to a card service is rather high. To simplify the
 * construction, this object encapsulates all parameters required for the
 * <i>Signature</i> service, except an optional pre-allocated channel.
 * Every parameter can be set explicitly by a method invocation. Access
 * to the parameters stored is provided only within this package.
 * <br>
 * The file access card service <tt>MFCSignatureService</tt> is derived from the
 * generic card service <tt>MFCCardService</tt>. Consequently, the parameters
 * are derived from the generic parameters, which are still required to
 * invoke the base class constructor.
